# Custom SDK for iPhoneOS3.0 using only OSS sources

> **Note for macOS users:** Appleâ€™s system `clang` may cause issues when building/using the SDK.  
> Please install a non-Apple Clang/LLVM (e.g. via Homebrew: `brew install llvm`) and set the compiler environment variable:  
> ```bash
> export CC=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang
> ```

## Build SDK
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Create SDK
```bash
cmake --install build
```

## Using the SDK

The SDK has two main purposes: providing a sysroot for cross-compilation and supplying the necessary cctools for building applications.

### Method 1: Direct Clang Flags

Configure your buildby passing the appropriate flags to `clang`:

```bash
# Set the sysroot
clang -isysroot /path/to/sdk

# Provide cctools
clang -B/path/to/sdk/usr/bin

# Combined usage
clang -isysroot /path/to/sdk -B/path/to/sdk/usr/bin [other flags] source.c
```

### Method 2: CMake Toolchain

For CMake projects, use the provided toolchain file to automatically configure the build environment:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="/path/to/sdk/cmake/Toolchain/common-3.0.cmake" -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```
